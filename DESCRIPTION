Description: A model of single-layer groundwater flow in steady-state
    under the Dupuit-Forchheimer assumption can be created by placing
    elements such as wells, area-sinks and line-sinks at arbitrary
    locations in the flow field. Output variables include hydraulic head
    and the discharge vector. Particle traces can be computed numerically
    in three dimensions. The underlying theory is described in Haitjema
    (1995) <doi:10.1016/B978-0-12-316550-3.X5000-4> and references
    therein.
